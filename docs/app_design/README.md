#Application Design

##General overview
Our app is the must have utility for anyone watching Game of Thrones. It provides the user the crucial information about a character, a house, or a location those very moments when it is most needed.

##How it works
In short, you search for anything, a character, a location, a house, an event, anything. Then you navigate to one of those things you got back from your search, where you get a list of all related things. That way, you can navigate around in that wonderful yet sadistic world of G.R.R. Martin while keeping an eye on the TV.


##Screens
Here is a list of the screens in our application:

* [Main Search]
* [Details]


[Main_Search]:MAIN_SEARCH.md
[details]:DETAILS.md


##Extension ideas
Here goes additional ideas not yet finalized enough to be included in the general design.

* Navigational map - a map of relationships between the entities
