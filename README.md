#angular2fun 
This project aims to develop an application against the evolving new Angular2 framework.  Our goal is to learn the framework and put it to the test while it is still open for changes.

cd angular2fun
npm install
# insall gulp, if you don't already have it:
npm install -g gulp
gulp...
```
